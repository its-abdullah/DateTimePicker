DateTimePicker is a js library ment to to provide a time picker along side keith-wood date picker.

#### why does this library exist?
while we were working on a huge project we found out that we need a datepicker that supports both Hijri and Gregorian Calenders and also provide a time picker as well.
We looked for a library that provides all of that on the internet but we couldn't find one, so we thought we should make it ourselves!

#### Why keith-wood date picker?
  keith-wood date picker support a lot of different calenders and also provide various functions such as converting between calenders.
  
 #### What we're planning to do next
* Setting up a good options
* adding convert date feature to the date picker
* depending on popper.js instead of Bootstrap popover
* working more on the style

## Dependancy
* jquery
* popper.js
* bootstrap
* jquery.plugins
* keith-wood calenders

## Installation
-this area is still under construction-

#### Notes
* We're a small busy team and fresh when it comes to building JS library so please bear with our humble experience.
* We've created a Slack channel, you're very welcome to join us, let us know what we've missed, help us improve this library to make it useful for everyone!
